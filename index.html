                    Hello, everyone! The time has finally come to release this Major Balance 1.3.0, and I believe it marks a step forward in the history of Naruto Arena Classic.
                    <p>Unfortunately, I believe this will be the last time the characters on the first page will be changed (except for those not mentioned on this list). However, I&#x27;m confident that with these adjustments, many new options will now be available for beginner players, as well as for higher-level players who aren&#x27;t yet fully accustomed to the newer characters.</p>
                    <p>My goal was to make each character worth picking, rather than just being another outdated starter option for your initial gameplay.</p>
                    <p>And yes, we&#x27;re aware that some characters may require a few hotfixes soon, but I think that&#x27;s a risk worth taking.</p>
                    <p>Also, we&#x27;ll soon have new missions to unlock custom borders so that players who have already completed all existing missions will have new reasons to keep playing beyond the Ladder. Keep in mind that custom border missions cannot be PURCHASED and you&#x27;ll have to complete them manually. (And I highly recommend you to complete these missions because, in the near future, I plan to release special characters that also won&#x27;t be available for purchase, which means you&#x27;ll need to complete these special border missions, okay?)</p>
                    <p>More details about today&#x27;s update will be shared on our official Discord.</p>

The time has finally come to release this Major Balance 1.3.0, and I believe it marks a step forward in the history of Naruto Arena Classic.\n                    \u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I believe this will be the last time the characters on the first page will be changed (except for those not mentioned on this list). However, I'm confident that with these adjustments, many new options will now be available for beginner players, as well as for higher-level players who aren't yet fully accustomed to the newer characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eMy goal was to make each character worth picking, rather than just being another outdated starter option for your initial gameplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eAnd yes, we're aware that some characters may require a few hotfixes soon, but I think that's a risk worth taking.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eAlso, we'll soon have new missions to unlock custom borders so that players who have already completed all existing missions will have new reasons to keep playing beyond the Ladder. Keep in mind that custom border missions cannot be PURCHASED and you'll have to complete them manually. (And I highly recommend you to complete these missions because, in the near future, I plan to release special characters that also won't be available for purchase, which means you'll need to complete these special border missions, okay?)\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eMore details about today's update will be shared on our official Discord.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \n                ","balanceCustomType":true,"balance":[{"name":"Edo Tensei Jinpachi (S)","type":"Nerfs","winrate":{"wins":"3199 (75.63%)","matchesPlayed":"4230 (3.83%)"},"skills":[{"name":"Explosive Tag Primer","text":["This skill now makes 'Explosive Tag Primer' deal 15 chakra piercing damage, down 5 from 20.","Any enemy that break its destructible defense now will receive 15 piercing damage, down 5 from 20."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/Ko68Yvv.png"},{"name":"Shibuki Explosion Chain","text":["This skill now costs 1 random chakra, up 1 from no cost."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/DdGU68F.png"},{"name":"Silent Explosion","text":["This skill now deals 20 piercing damage, up 5 from 15.","This skill now reduces 5 non-affliction damage, down 5 from 10.","This skill no longer costs 1 additional random chakra when 'Shibuki Explosion Chain' was used on the last turn. \u003cspan class=\"nothing\"\u003e(Only for 'Explosive Tag Primer')\u003c/span\u003e"],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/RKv7ubV.png"}],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/ljV9Yzu.png"},{"name":"Edo Tensei Mangetsu (S)","type":"Nerfs","winrate":{"wins":"2715 (75.42%)","matchesPlayed":"3600 (3.24%)"},"skills":[{"name":"Mist Sword Summoning","text":["This skill no longer grants Mangetsu 5 points of damage reduction.","Kubikiribocho: Now grants 10 points of destructible defense, down 5 from 15.","Shibuki: Now deals 5 permanent affliction damage, down 5 from 10."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/vU96NVd.png"},{"name":"Hydrification Technique","text":["This skill now has also a chance to choose no class at all to ignore."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/71NAFSG.png"}],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/4QcN9uF.png"},{"name":"Uzumaki Naruto","type":"Major Balance","winrate":{"wins":"795 (33.47%)","matchesPlayed":"2375 (2.14%)"},"skills":[{"name":"Uzumaki Naruto Combo","text":["This skill now deals 20 damage, up 5 from 15."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/Uy1TKG3.png"},{"name":"Shadow Clones","text":["This skill now makes 'Uzumaki Naruto Combo' deal 10 additional damage, down 5 from 15."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/98c5RRL.png"},{"name":"Passive: Kyuubi's Chakra Awakening (NEW SKILL)","url":"https://i.imgur.com/vU2LIZQ.png","text":["When Naruto reaches 50 health for the first time, Kyuubi's chakra will awaken, healing Naruto for 5 health every turn permanently.

So, it's just getting fixed now. lol\u003c/span\u003e"],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/g0ZItPe.png"}],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/lFtTPeQ.png"},{"name":"Darui (S)","type":"Nerfs","winrate":{"wins":"5063 (69.41%)","matchesPlayed":"7294 (3.80%)"},"skills":[{"name":"Laser Circus","text":["This skill now deals 15 piercing damage, down 5 from 20."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/gnwtJrI.png"},{"name":"Electric Water Encampment Wall","text":["This skill now has no cost.","This skill now deals damage only to enemies that use a new harmful skill for 1 turn."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/arWmbIl.png"}],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/4zQxemJ.png"},{"name":"Mifune (S)","type":"Nerfs","winrate":{"wins":"2715 (66.56%)","matchesPlayed":"4079 (2.13%)"},"skills":[{"name":"Samurai Troops","text":["This skill now is classed as Ranged, instead of Melee."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/BTOiy9P.png"},{"name":"Iaito","text":["This skill no longer ignores invulnerability."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/N9z93nK.png"},{"name":"Raiton Pierce","text":["This skill now is classed as Ranged, instead of Melee."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/0jU2BHv.png"}],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/dU6F330.png"},{"name":"Shinobi Alliance Naruto (S)","type":"Nerfs","winrate":{"wins":"1499 (64.45%)","matchesPlayed":"2326 (1.21%)"},"skills":[{"name":"Planetary Rasengan","text":["This skill now deals 35 damage, down 5 from 40."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/wV3yPye.png"},{"name":"Mini-Bijuudama","text":["This skill now deals 35 affliction damage, down 5 from 40."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/YsfPSVu.png"},{"name":"Mini-Rasenshuriken","text":["The enemy countered by 'Summoning: Mayhem' now receives 15 additional damage from this skill, down 5 from 20 additional damage."],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/yAY1DDM.png"}],"url":"https://i.imgur.com/VlK9BfK.png"},{"name":"Hyuuga Hiashi (S)","type":"Tweaks","winrate":{"wins":"231 (63.29%)","matchesPlayed":"365 (0.19%)"},"skills":[{"name":"Master Gentle Fist","text":["This skill no longer removes chakra in the second turn, only first turn.","This skill now removes 1 taijutsu or 1 ninjutsu chakra, instead of 1 random chakra","This skill's initial damage now deals 25 damage, up 5 from 20.

Previously, we introduced the goal type of playing with two characters on the same team, but it wasn\u0026#39;t well received by the community (it doesn\u0026#39;t mean it won\u0026#39;t be used anymore, but it will appear less frequently). So we decided to introduce a new objective that involves using a character\u0026#39;s skill a specific number of times, which will be themed according to the mission and eventually become more interactive. This goal type doesn\u0026#39;t require you to win the match, only to use the specified skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \n                \u003cp\u003eFeel free to send suggestions for new types of goals for missions in the #suggestions channel on our Discord and, soon, in the suggestion forum on our Naruto Boards!\u003c/p\u003e\n                \n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eChanges on Uzumaki Naruto:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n                We decided to make a change to the \u0026#39;Naruto Rasengan\u0026#39; skill with the intention of making the stun more solid but removing its damage potential. I decided to bring up this topic because this change is not necessarily a boost or a nerf since it can be better in certain scenarios and worse in others. Depending on community feedback, we may revert it to the version before these changes. I hope you see this as a way to test how Naruto will perform in the Ladder Game and also in the War scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eNew Characters:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                \u003cp\u003e \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"/chars/hozuki-suigetsu-(s)\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FQbDQSx.jpeg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eHozuki Suigetsu (S) is a native of Kirigakure who was once a captive of Orochimaru.
